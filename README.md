## Usage

This app can be used to quickly create a team profile webpage for easy access to your team's important info, email and GitHub profiles. After completing the series of questions, you will have a new HTML file that you can open in your web browser.

-   You will be prompted with a series of questions about the manager and additional employees.
-   The question types used include text input, yes/no questions and a list. Type in text input answers, use the up/down arrows for the list then enter to select the answer, and y/n then enter for the yes/no questions.
-   Once all the questions have been answered, your answers will print to the terminal and a confirmation will also appear in the terminal that your HTML file has been generated.
-   A new HTML file named index.html will be created in the /dist directory along with a style.css file in the /assets/style directory.
-   Open the index.html in your web browser to view the generated webpage.
-   If moving the index.html and the style.css files to another directory, make sure to move both the index.html and /assets directory because the CSS file in there is needed for the index.html file.
